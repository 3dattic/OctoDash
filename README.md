## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an issue, while using OctoDash please have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/UnchartedBull/OctoDash/wiki/Troubleshooting) first! If your issue is not covered please open an issue!

## Bugs and more

If you find a bug, please open an issue, so I can have a look at it. Please also add the steps to reproduce and the .gcode file. Thank you!

One more thing: If you're Octoprint is running on a Raspberry Pi 1 you may want to opt out of this because it just does not have enough power.

## Contributing

If you can think of something nice to add or want to change some of the messy code feel free to create a Pull Request. I'll have a look at it and will merge it into master if everything checks out!
Any help is greatly appreciated!

If you can think of a great feature, but don't feel yet ready to code something open an issue. I'll have a look at it and maybe implement it if I have the time. It is preferred if you directly create a Pull Request for your new feature. If you need some help, I can point you in the correct direction.
